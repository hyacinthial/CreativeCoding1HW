The last time I'd thought or heard about "learning styles" must've been back in elementary or middle school. 
I know that back then it was a big discussion, but in my tiny school no talk was very big. Obviously this 
article is arguing against learning styles being helpful, and while I would love to argue against it, I 
remember thinking even as a kid, when a friend would tell me they were a "hands on learner," that they were 
only saying that because it was more fun. I think people gravitate toward what they enjoy, and I suppose I 
do believe that it's easier for me to learn when it's enjoyable, though I don't necessarily think that the 
quality of the learning is any better. I associate the talk about learning styles with the entertainment that 
is zodiac signs, they’re fun to talk about but likely don’t mean much of anything.
