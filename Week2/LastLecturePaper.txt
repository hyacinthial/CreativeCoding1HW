If there’s anything this lecture told me I’ve been doing right, it’s respect. I have always tried my best to be respectful to those around me, whether they are more or less of an authority, or whether I’m talking to them or speaking about them. I have always thought slandering the people in my life was indecent, even if they were truly horrible to me— just as Pausch said in the lecture, there’s always a good side to somebody, and just because they’re not showing it to me doesn’t mean they’re not showing it to anybody else. There’s a few things this lecture told me I haven’t been doing very well. The moment I see a brick wall I collapse, I’ve forgotten how to care for others, and I often spend way too much time complaining; I have changed from someone who never would’ve given up into someone who gives up all too often. I’m writing this at 10:56PM because I gave up on everything this week. Still, I’m happy because at least I’m writing it; I haven’t quite fallen into the habit of giving up completely, and I know that I can change since I’ve been changing all my life! I believe that my wants in life are strong enough to take me past barriers, and I can acknowledge this even when I’m not feeling my strongest. That alone leaves me with some comfort and confidence in my mindset :)
